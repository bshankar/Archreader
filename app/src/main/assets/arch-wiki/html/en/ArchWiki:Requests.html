<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Broken_package_links">Broken package links</span></h3>
<p>ArchWiki contains many broken links to packages not found either in <a href="../en/Official_repositories.html" title="Official repositories">official repositories</a> or <a href="../en/Arch_User_Repository.html" title="AUR" class="mw-redirect">AUR</a>, which is the result of packages being merged, split or removed from the repositories. All pages in the main namespace are regularly checked by a bot, which checks all instances of <a href="../en/Template:AUR.html" title="Template:AUR">AUR</a>, <a href="../en/Template:Grp.html" title="Template:Grp">Grp</a> and <a href="../en/Template:Pkg.html" title="Template:Pkg">Pkg</a> templates, tries to automatically update them and marks them with <a href="../en/Template:Broken_package_link.html" title="Template:Broken package link">Template:Broken package link</a> when it is not possible to update them automatically.
</p>
<p>To fix a broken package link, do <b>not</b> simply remove the reference to the packages from the wiki, do some research first:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Search the package database (<code>pacman -Ss</code>) and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/">AUR</a>, it is possible that the package was merged/renamed.</li>
<li> If looking for a specific file, for example a binary that was part of the package, <a href="../en/Pkgfile.html" title="Pkgfile">pkgfile</a> might do the trick.</li>
<li> If unsure, mark the page or section with an appropriate <a href="../en/Help:Template.html#Article_status_templates" title="Help:Template">status template</a> rather than completely removing the reference to the package.</li>
</ul>
<p>To help with manual updates, each "broken package link" template provides a hint:
</p>
<ul>
<li> "invalid number of template parameters" – All <a href="../en/Template:AUR.html" title="Template:AUR">AUR</a>, <a href="../en/Template:Grp.html" title="Template:Grp">Grp</a> and <a href="../en/Template:Pkg.html" title="Template:Pkg">Pkg</a> templates take exactly one parameter, but the wikitext specified more (or none). In most cases the excesive parameters should be moved to the surrounding text, or removed if already there.</li>
<li> "replaced with <i>[other package]</i>" – The package was renamed or merged into another, which specifies the old package name in the <a href="../en/PKGBUILD.html#replaces" title="PKGBUILD">replaces</a> array. In most cases the old package should be simply replaced with the new one and surrounding text updated accordingly.</li>
<li> "archived in <a href="../en/Template:Aur-mirror.html" title="Template:Aur-mirror">aur-mirror</a>" – Marks old AUR3 packages, which were not submitted to AUR4, or were deleted since then. You may consider resubmitting them to the AUR if interested in maintaining them.</li>
<li> "package not found" – Default hint when none of the above applies.</li>
</ul>
<p>All pages with broken package links are tracked in <a href="../en/Category:Pages_with_broken_package_links.html" title="Category:Pages with broken package links">Category:Pages with broken package links</a>. There is also an automatic report page at <a href="../User:Lahwaacz.bot/Reports/archpkgs.html" title="User:Lahwaacz.bot/Reports/archpkgs">User:Lahwaacz.bot/Reports/archpkgs</a>.
</p>
<div style="padding: 5px; margin: 0.50em 0; background-color: #DDDDFF; border: thin solid #BBBBDD; overflow: hidden;">
<strong> Note: </strong>The bot updates only package links, but not the text around them, which is too context-sensitive. For example, in <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Smokeping&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=308608">[1]</a> the AUR link was changed to Pkg, but the surrounding text still says that the package is in AUR. These instances can be fixed and "future-proofed" by simply removing the surrounding description of where the package is; see also <a href="../en/Help:Style.html#Package_management_instructions" title="Help:Style">Help:Style#Package management instructions</a>. We currently have no means of automatically tracking this kind of problems, suggestions are welcome.</div>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Left-Handed_Adjustments_for_Desktop_Environments">Left-Handed Adjustments for Desktop Environments</span></h3>
<p>I was thinking it would be helpful for lefties if there were a list of configuration options for each desktop environment that facilitate left-handed use of mice and touchpads. I'm not sure if this is related enough to Arch to include in this wiki, but I haven't had a lot of luck finding information for my own DE (KDE) let alone for others. I will start writing down information, and if no one else thinks there should be a separate page for this, I'll just add the information I find to each individual DE's page. —<a href="../User:Ajrl.html" title="User:Ajrl">ajrl</a> 2013-08-11T15:09−06:00

<dl><dd> I think a separate page is better. -- <a href="../User:Fengchao.html" title="User:Fengchao">Fengchao</a> (<a href="../User_talk:Fengchao.html" title="User talk:Fengchao">talk</a>) 11:58, 12 August 2013 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Input_methods">Input methods</span></h3>
<p>Currently there is no page on ArchWiki properly describing various input methods <i>generally</i>. There is only <a href="../en/Internationalization.html#Input_methods_in_Xorg" title="Internationalization">Internationalization#Input_methods_in_Xorg</a>, but it has several problems:
</p>
<ul>
<li> missing descriptions</li>
<li> <a href="../en/Keyboard_configuration_in_Xorg.html#Configuring_compose_key" title="Keyboard configuration in Xorg">X compose key</a> does not fit in</li>
<li> GTK has a default "simple" input method featuring the <code>Ctrl+Shift+u</code> shortcut for entering a unicode character (this was added recently into a wrong article: <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Bash&amp;diff=289079&amp;oldid=287436">[2]</a>) - again, no description</li>
<li> no description of XIM - outdated, but sometimes used as fallback?</li>
</ul>
<p>So this is quite enough material to start a new great article ;)

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="DRI">DRI</span></h3>
<p>An article, or even stub that links to resources, explaining what DRI is, why it's important, differences between DRI 1, 2, 3, how DRI1 is no longer supported as of xorg-server 1.13, simple xorg.conf code explaining the DRI section, enabling the composite and render extensions there, these and more. Just my thoughts.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="ldns">ldns</span></h3>
<p>ldns is a core package with no wiki documentation. It is also relatively new in the world of DNS tools and is not well covered on the Internet. Documentation of basic features and what it is not (eg a replacement for bind) would provide a valueable resource.

<dl><dd>The description of the <span class="plainlinks archwiki-template-pkg"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/?name=ldns">ldns</a></span> package is "Fast DNS <b>library</b> supporting recent RFCs". The <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/ldns/">official homepage</a> mentions that several example programs are included with the library, the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://www.nlnetlabs.nl/projects/ldns/doc/index.html">official docs</a> is probably best for programmers. -- <a href="../User:Lahwaacz.html" title="User:Lahwaacz">Lahwaacz</a> (<a href="../User_talk:Lahwaacz.html" title="User talk:Lahwaacz">talk</a>) 21:37, 17 February 2014 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Perl">Perl</span></h3>
<p>Surprisingly, there is no wiki page describing the installation and configuration of Perl, unlike Python, Ruby etc. Could include the installation of CPAN modules and a list of good tutorials for beginners, too. So far there is only guides for packaging Perl and its modules (<a href="../en/Perl_Policy.html" title="Perl Policy">Perl Policy</a> and <a href="../en/Perl_package_guidelines.html" title="Perl package guidelines">Perl package guidelines</a> respectively) -- <a href="/index.php?title=User:Bluestreak0&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:Bluestreak0 (page does not exist)">bluestreak0</a> 01:32, 17 April 2014 (UTC)

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Linux_console">Linux console</span></h3>
<p>I was thinking that a new page for the console would be a good idea. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_console" class="extiw" title="wikipedia:Linux console">Wikipedia:Linux console</a> article gives a short general overview, but obviously doesn't concern the configuration. Since it's an independent system, configured separately from any graphical environment, it would bring together several related sections across multiple articles in one place. It's a fairly complex system and difficult to cover in any depth in small sections across other articles (such as <a href="../en/Fonts.html" title="Fonts">Fonts</a>). I've put together a basic example, <a href="../User:Teppic74/Linux_console.html" title="User:Teppic74/Linux console">User:Teppic74/Linux_console</a>. -- <a href="../User:Teppic74.html" title="User:Teppic74">Teppic74</a> (<a href="../User_talk:Teppic74.html" title="User talk:Teppic74">talk</a>) 17:11, 3 July 2014 (UTC)

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sublime-text">Sublime-text</span></h3>
<p>I think creating a page and mentioning ways to improve sublime-text integration with Gnome would be a good idea.
The trick is if you run sublime with <i>--class=&lt;filename of sublime text .desktop file, e.g. sublime_text_3&gt;</i>, it would help Gnome and XFCE to group sublime instances with its respective desktop file.
This is mentioned in the comments of the aur package but I think it's better that this would be in the wiki.--<a href="/index.php?title=User:183.amir&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:183.amir (page does not exist)">183.amir</a> (<a href="/index.php?title=User_talk:183.amir&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User talk:183.amir (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 12:41, 19 December 2014 (UTC)

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="iPXE">iPXE</span></h3>
<p>iPXE is a powerful network boot program with many features. Currently, there is no iPXE specific page to describe iPXE in details.
There are some pages mentioning iPXE in the wiki, mostly related to network booting, without any further instruction on how to get iPXE to work.
So I think it's worth to add a page with detailed iPXE explanation in the wiki.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Change_drive_naming.2Faccessing_to_UUID.3F">Change drive naming/accessing to UUID?</span></h3>
<p>Trying to install drives with/out Luks, LVM on internal, external drives is quite complicated currently. Following the ralated articles suggest different ways of reaching the goal. Many different drive name conventions are suggested, eg.:
</p>
<ul>
<li> /dev/sda2</li>
<li> /dev/md0</li>
<li> /dev/mapper/md/0</li>
<li> /dev/mapper/vgroup-lvm-root</li>
<li> /dev/vgroup-luks/root</li>
<li> ...</li>
</ul>
<p>Some of them don't work with portable external drives. This overcomplicates setting up encrypted drives in different situations. My suggestion is, to change all drive related articles to one specific solution of addressing drives universal. Currently I think of UUDI drive naming as a way to go. This would ease the process of drive naming in all kinds of situations:
</p>
<ul>
<li> The reader is guided through system setup along one red line</li>
<li> Troubleshootiing "no drie found" is strait forward</li>
<li> Many sections become clearer to read even when not reading the whole article</li>
<li> Articles are easier to write and maintain</li>
<li> Beginners have an easier read and geta better idea of how to access drives</li>
<li> Accessing internal/external encrypted drives is easy</li>
</ul>
<p>' LMV or other virtual file systems are easier to describe and setup
</p>
<p>Ok, I know it is a big suggestion. I wanted to bring it up here, bacause I have the impression that following one primary path would help a lot - everyone involved. It doesn't need to be done in one day. While I think to have one suggested guideline would be a good start. Then with thain mind, we all have it easier to change those sections while Writing/editing Wiki entries.

<dd>Hi, To your own examples above: using an UUID for a /dev/mapper/* device declaration is generally unnecessary (the uniqueness of the device is determined when it is mapped). I think you overestimate the amount of users who actually require setting up the examples where it really matters (e.g. external drives). What I don't understand is why you consider using UUIDs being easier to read/describe. For starters the terribly long UUIDs will break formatting in many cases, e.g. making code blocks in-text not possible. An UUID itself gives no contextual hint, something that a device name does. If you look at the three examples in <a href="../en/Persistent_block_device_naming.html#Boot_managers" title="Persistent block device naming">Persistent block device naming#Boot managers</a>, you really find the UUID one the easiest?  </dd>
<dd>I think you are certainly right in that we may lack crosslinks to <a href="../en/Persistent_block_device_naming.html" title="Persistent block device naming">Persistent_block_device_naming</a> in some articles where it may be important to use an UUID. Maybe we also need an example section to illustrate singular important points in <a href="../en/Persistent_block_device_naming.html" title="Persistent block device naming">Persistent block device naming</a> and maybe there are individual articles/sections where content should indeed use a form of persistent naming straight away. </dd>
<dd>Suggestion: How about using <a href="../en/Talk:Persistent_block_device_naming.html" title="Talk:Persistent block device naming">Talk:Persistent block device naming</a> to assemble a list of <i>particular</i> article sections with content where persistent naming should be made more prominent? That way we could also figure if and which examples may be useful to be added. --<a href="../User:Indigo.html" title="User:Indigo">Indigo</a> (<a href="../User_talk:Indigo.html" title="User talk:Indigo">talk</a>) 17:47, 30 March 2015 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Hi, I started this topic because "by design" Linux has so many ways to assign drives and the Wiki uses them kind of "randomly". Finding the <i>best drive naming method</i> for the Wiki is my intention. Giving the reader a hand, by enabling him/her to understand one way of accessing drives and collect all the others somewhere.</dd>
<dd>I'm suggesting UUIDs, because they can be used for local and mobile situations. They are easy to use. The UUID format is universal and is independent of the location (local/mobile) or the context (LVM, Raid, Luks, ...) in which they are used.</dd>
<dd>The reason why I'm bring this up is, that it seems, the wiki has currently no standardized form of drive path declaration. If we can find one practical method, it will be easier to write, edit and maintain articles. Everyone involved will know then, which method is the recommended.</dd>
<dd>Therefore, I wanted to start an open conversation, to find ideas to improve the situation. I guess, UUIDs are also a good choice, because they are easy to substitute with pseudo code, eg.:
<ul><li> "mount /dev/disks/by-uuid/e9ea05ce-0ccb-87a1-c71e-90fab8be1944 /mnt"</li></ul>
</dd>
<dd>could then be written as:
<ul><li> "/dev/disks/by-uuid/[UUID] /mnt"</li></ul>
</dd>
<dd>instead of having the choice of:
<ul>
<li> "mount /dev/sda3 <b>or</b> </li>
<li> /dev/mapper/vgroup--lvm-root <b>or</b>
</li>
<li> /dev/md/0 <b>or</b>
</li>
<li> /dev/md0 <b>or</b> </li>
<li> <b>...</b> /mnt"</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The reader immediately knows:
<ul><li> "I just need to alter [UUID]"</li></ul>
</dd>
<dd>There is no need to know of all possible alternative methods making use of the Wiki example. Because the user already learned (Beginners Guide) how to determine UUIDs those examples are well adoptable.</dd>
<dd>Reduced uncertainties like the reader had before:
<ul>
<li> Can I use that example's local path in my case, too?</li>
<li> What's my case anyway? And how is it different for the one provided?</li>
<li> Is my drive IDE, SATA or ... what?</li>
<li> Where and how is the correct format of my drive/partitions's path?</li>
<li> I need an example to boot my USB drive everywhere. That provided example doesn't work for me. Where is the article I need to know?</li>
<li> I skimmed through many articles, no success so far. There must be one, but where?</li>
<li> I have an Luks, Raid, LVM (or mixed) situation here. The current article just uses /dev/sdi3. What to do?</li>
<li> Which article do I need to read first? I can't use the current example. How about alternatives?</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The reader's issue is, that "/dev/sdb3" drive paths aren't that descriptive without the knowledge of how and when they are used as written. They are nice for that particular situation, but may immediately loose their meaning in other use cases?!</dd>
<dd>If we could pick out one drive naming method the Wiki uses, then we are able to eliminate many of the upper soliloquies and ...
<ul>
<li> We get a good article structure for the writer, reader and maintainer.</li>
<li> The provided method will work in either situation (local/mobile/..).</li>
<li> All alternative methods can be listed in <b>one</b> conversion article/table.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>The reader can quickly move on reading the article:
<ul><li> <i>Great, I already know how to determine UUIDs. I just change it.</i>.</li></ul>
</dd>
<dd>As you mentioned, crosslinks then point to one subpage, where the conversion to other alternative methods is explained.</dd>
<dd>Don't get me wrong, I don't want to imply something is wrong with the current way the Wiki does it. This just a natural process how something grows. A bit of standardization may help here.</dd>
<dd>I'm for UUIDs so far, because are easily exchangeable and can be written as <b>[UUID]</b> in the Wiki.</dd>
<dd> OMG, I wrote a huge wall of text. Sorry for that. It's not easy and very time consuming writing down what I wanted to say. as a non-native speaker. I hope, it's now easier to understand what my intention was. I'm kind of uncertain that I found the right words. --<a href="/index.php?title=User:T.ask&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="User:T.ask (page does not exist)">T.ask</a> (<a href="../User_talk:T.ask.html" title="User talk:T.ask">talk</a>) 13:24, 31 March 2015 (UTC)</dd>

<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl>
<dd>Thank you for elaborating on the background of why you propose it. No need to apologize at all for taking the time to give input how to improve our wiki! I just want to add two thoughts on it: </dd>
<dd>(1) One reason descriptive device declarations (/dev/sda/...) are easy to grasp is that everyone is used to them. It starts when you open any partitioning tool - you start it for a device from the /dev tree. Try to find the term "UUID" in the manpage of cfdisk/cgdisk/parted (fdisk has it, the others not a mention). With this I don't want to say your intention to introduce the user early to use persistent naming is wrong, just that using descriptive naming is common and, thereby, accessible to the reader. </dd>
<dd>(2) I like your idea of using a "/dev/disks/by-uuid/[<s>YOUR</s>UUID] /mnt" format (we call other instances of such 'pseudo-variables'). Still, if you used it in an article context, e.g. an encrypted LVM, you would still have to more verbosely describe <b>which</b> dev/blockdevice/vg/lv UUID is meant to be mounted on /mnt. I still can't really picture for myself how writing and reading it is easier in general. </dd>
<dd>As I wrote above, I agree we might need to pinpoint the advantages of persistent naming more, but we do some already (e.g. right from the start: <a href="../en/Installation_guide.html#Generate_an_fstab" title="Beginners' guide" class="mw-redirect">Beginners' guide#Generate an fstab</a>). In short I believe we are better off with the way we have it (no rule on it, as long as the contribution fits the article contributed to all editors may choose what's best in context). That's it from me. Looking forward to read feedback &amp; other opinions. --<a href="../User:Indigo.html" title="User:Indigo">Indigo</a> (<a href="../User_talk:Indigo.html" title="User talk:Indigo">talk</a>) 20:46, 31 March 2015 (UTC)</dd>
</dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd><dl><dd><dl>
<dd>IMO man page examples are sometimes a bit behind "new standards". That's natural and this shouldn't prevent us from moving a bit more forward. With Arch we have <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_Unique_Identifier">UUIDs</a> - lets use them :)</dd>
<dd>In case the user doesn't know UUIDs, we will guide him/her to a short conversion-table/article on how to switch to UUIDs. Actually it's much easier to grasp than often thought: 
<ul><li> Just enter <b>lsblk -f</b> and it's obvious which UUID points to which drive in any context (raid, luks, lvm, ...). As this <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://dpaste.com/3RYFAPY">Get UUID example</a> shows, just copy the corresponding UUID and use it with all UUID Wiki examples. IMHO it's quite easy.</li></ul>
</dd>
<dd>I see where you are coming from, while I'm confident the reader will  learn fast how UUIDs work. A new user will not even know which other options have been there before. Moreover, as the reader is already familiar with UUIDs he/she won't experience future problems with moving drives around. The experienced user just reads the conversion-table/article.</dd>
<dd>You see, I'm quite confident that the user will grasp UUIDs easily. Also, this will prevent him/her from experiencing future problems. We just need the courage to do the first step. It's not something we need to do in one day. We have all the time to slowly move into one direction.</dd>
<dd>That's why I would also appreciate other opinions on this topic here.</dd>

Before <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://github.com/lahwaacz/wiki-scripts/issues/36">automatic solution</a> is implemented, what would you say to automatically marking these with <a href="../en/Template:Broken_section_link.html" title="Template:Broken section link">Template:Broken section link</a>, similarly to how broken package links are marked with <a href="../en/Template:Broken_package_link.html" title="Template:Broken package link">Template:Broken package link</a>? -- <a href="../User:Lahwaacz.html" title="User:Lahwaacz">Lahwaacz</a> (<a href="../User_talk:Lahwaacz.html" title="User talk:Lahwaacz">talk</a>) 14:14, 22 July 2016 (UTC)

<dl><dd>+1. That would be helpful indeed. Maybe leave out the hint in the template to keep it short. <a href="../User:Indigo.html" title="User:Indigo">Indigo</a> (<a href="../User_talk:Indigo.html" title="User talk:Indigo">talk</a>) 17:45, 22 July 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<dl><dd><dl><dd>I have made it look like this for now, with a link to this section: <sup>[<a href="#Broken_section_links">broken link</a>: invalid section]</sup> Of course feel free to modify it, there won't be any marked links for some time anyway... -- <a href="../User:Lahwaacz.html" title="User:Lahwaacz">Lahwaacz</a> (<a href="../User_talk:Lahwaacz.html" title="User talk:Lahwaacz">talk</a>) 12:20, 4 August 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Perfect, thanks. It can already be seen in recent changes how helpful it is having them marked. </dd>

<dl><dd>Interesting to see how many broken section links there are, and how long they went unnoticed... thanks for the upgrade! -- <a href="../User:Alad.html" title="User:Alad">Alad</a> (<a href="../User_talk:Alad.html" title="User talk:Alad">talk</a>) 13:04, 7 August 2016 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Subpages in the main namespace are finally enabled <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="https://git.archlinux.org/vhosts/wiki.archlinux.org.git/commit/?id=c20bddf2d35e5d9185262a46fda7ca91a4eade0c">[6]</a>, so e.g. <a href="../en/GRUB/Tips_and_tricks.html" title="GRUB/Tips and tricks">GRUB/Tips and tricks</a> is now a true subpage of <a href="../en/GRUB.html" title="GRUB">GRUB</a>. Among other benefits, there is now an automatic link on each subpage leading to every existing parent page, so manual phrases like "See <a href="../en/GRUB.html" title="GRUB">GRUB</a> for the main article." on top of subpages are now useless and should be removed. -- <a href="../User:Lahwaacz.html" title="User:Lahwaacz">Lahwaacz</a> (<a href="../User_talk:Lahwaacz.html" title="User talk:Lahwaacz">talk</a>) 19:17, 23 July 2016 (UTC)
