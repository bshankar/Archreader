<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="2016.2F07.2F08_-_11_years_of_ArchWiki">2016/07/08 - 11 years of ArchWiki</span></h2>
<p>Today the wiki celebrates 11 years of activity, an amazing accomplishment for a project that is kept alive solely by volunteer contributions! As it has always been, there's a lot <a href="../Special:RecentChanges.html" title="Special:RecentChanges">going on</a> even right now while you're reading: in particular you should be aware that the <a href="../en/Installation_guide.html" title="Beginners' guide" class="mw-redirect">Beginners' guide</a> and the <a href="../en/Installation_guide.html" title="Installation guide">Installation guide</a> are just about to be unified into a single article, after years of attempts and small shifts towards this goal; if you want to participate, see what's happening in <a href="../en/Talk:Beginners'_guide.html" title="Talk:Beginners' guide" class="mw-redirect">Talk:Beginners' guide</a>, and possibly also refer to the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://lists.archlinux.org/pipermail/arch-dev-public/2016-July/028140.html">mailing-list thread</a> or the special wiki birthday <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=214373">forum thread</a>. And don't forget the brand-new <a href="../en/ArchWiki:IRC.html" title="ArchWiki:IRC">#archlinux-wiki</a> channel if you feel more at ease on IRC.
</p>
<p>If you have ever authored an edit in any of our thousands articles, even if only once, even if only to make a small correction, <b>thank you</b>!!! The value of this work is the sum of innumerable small contributions from people who don't follow the "somebody else will fix it" philosophy: most people here are not PhD's in Computer Science, we simply share a passion for Arch Linux, the broader FOSS community and pretty much anything related to the digital computing world, therefore if you think this sounds like you but you've never bothered creating an account, take the few seconds needed to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php?title=Special:UserLogin&amp;type=signup">do it now</a>, and start sharing your skills and knowledge, whatever their size is; you will find that the more you <a href="../en/ArchWiki:Contributing.html" title="ArchWiki:Contributing">contribute</a>, the more you will learn and improve yourself too, so it's a win-win choice ;)
</p>
<p>Anyway, Happy Birthday ArchWiki, and everybody keep up the good work!

<p>The ArchWiki has thousands of articles, and hundreds of different users edit it every month: keeping the whole project together, ensuring that it always sails in strict accordance to Arch's principles, is a task that requires a great deal of organizational work behind the scenes.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="2015.2F07.2F08_-_ArchWiki_turns_10.21">2015/07/08 - ArchWiki turns 10!</span></h2>
<p>Exactly 10 years ago, on July 8th 2005, the ArchWiki was <a href="../en/ArchWiki:About.html#History" title="ArchWiki:About">installed</a> with the MediaWiki engine: since then,
more than <a href="../Special:Statistics.html" title="Special:Statistics">20,000</a> users created their account and made almost 400,000 edits that evolved the initial blank page into this fantastic
documentation resource that innumerable Arch and non-Arch Linux users every day browse from all around the world.
</p>
<p>For the future, several major improvements are already under discussion or planning in various talk pages, with <a href="../en/Talk:Beginners'_guide.html#Unification" title="Talk:Beginners' guide" class="mw-redirect">Talk:Beginners' guide#Unification</a>,
<a href="../en/Help_talk:I18n.html#Language_namespace.28s.29_in_place_of_suffixes.3F" title="Help talk:I18n">Help talk:I18n#Language namespace(s) in place of suffixes?</a>, <a href="../en/ArchWiki:Requests.html#Should_we_remove_or_archive_obsolete_articles.3F" title="ArchWiki:Requests">ArchWiki:Requests#Should we remove or archive obsolete articles?</a> or
<a href="../en/ArchWiki_talk:Maintenance_Team.html#Reorganization" title="ArchWiki talk:Maintenance Team">ArchWiki talk:Maintenance Team#Reorganization</a> being only some notable examples. For this anniversary, <a href="../en/ArchWiki:Statistics.html" title="ArchWiki:Statistics">ArchWiki:Statistics</a>
has been expanded, and many more ideas have been brought up in its talk page to better show the evolution of the
wiki and try to give something back to the most active contributors.
</p>
<p>If you did not make it to get involved in the community of contributors in the past decade, you are very welcome to become one of the first ones of the decade
that has just started! The wiki syntax is very easy to learn and use, you can find an introduction in <a href="../en/Help:Editing.html" title="Help:Editing">Help:Editing</a>, and <a href="../en/ArchWiki:Contributing.html" title="ArchWiki:Contributing">ArchWiki:Contributing</a> is there to
give you plenty of inspiration about how and where to start. If you have any questions, just ask in the talk page of one of those pages, or any other
that suits your specific issue, and the wiki staff, or possibly other proactive users, will try their best to give you a quick and accurate answer.
</p>
<p>Well, Happy Birthday ArchWiki, then! The celebrations will go on until the weekend, as for example the 11th is the anniversary of the first edit: if you want, you can take this chance to make a small gift edit to your favorite article ;) Let's keep working together to make this project grow better and better for the next 10 years and more, thanks everybody!

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="2015.2F05.2F24_-_Restyled_AUR_template">2015/05/24 - Restyled AUR template</span></h2>
<p><a href="../en/Template:AUR.html" title="Template:AUR">Template:AUR</a> has been restyled with the addition of an "AUR" superscript to make AUR packages look different from official ones: this has the consequence that almost all articles mentioning AUR packages now have a redundant "from the <a href="../en/Arch_User_Repository.html" title="AUR" class="mw-redirect">AUR</a>" wording that needs to be removed. In the same fashion, the "from the <a href="../en/Official_repositories.html" title="Official repositories">official repositories</a>" wording associated to official packages is deprecated.
</p>
<p>Describing how to install a package is still forbidden by <a href="../en/Help:Style.html#Package_management_instructions" title="Help:Style">Help:Style#Package management instructions</a> but, for both official and AUR packages, you can use the "install" word as a link, e.g. <code>[[Install]]</code>, to point users to the <a href="../en/Help:Reading.html#Installation_of_packages" title="Install" class="mw-redirect">centralized package installation instructions</a>.
</p>
<p>This change was discussed and voted in <a href="../en/Help_talk:Style.html#Pkg_and_AUR_templates:_add_icon.2C_make_them_look_different" title="Help talk:Style">Help talk:Style#Pkg and AUR templates: add icon, make them look different</a>.

<p>The ingredients of a healthy and successful wiki are both the addition of fresh, up-to-date content (the "attack"), but also protection from counter-productive edits (the "defense").

Just add a bunch of your favorite articles to your <i>watchlist</i> and follow their changes, taking action when necessary: the wiki will receive your love with gratitude :) See <a href="../en/ArchWiki:Contributing.html#The_most_important_task" title="ArchWiki:Contributing">ArchWiki:Contributing#The most important task</a> for a more extensive introduction.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="2010.2F01.2F14_-_Internationalization_guidelines">2010/01/14 - Internationalization guidelines</span></h2>
<p>As you may have noticed, many articles have been moving around this past month; especially non-English ones. This was due to a recent discussion on the topic of ArchWiki internationalization. As a result, new guidelines have been drafted and a major transition has begun.
</p>
<p>For more detail, please see the related <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=87189">forum thread</a> and <a href="../en/Help:I18n.html" title="Help:I18n">Help:i18n</a>. Briefly, the following standards have been set:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Non-English article titles should be of the form <b>Title in English (Language)</b>, where "Language" is the localized spelling of the language.</li>
<li> Localized titles can and should still be created, but only as redirects to the English-named article.</li>
<li> <a href="../en/Template:I18n.html" title="Template:I18n">Template:i18n</a> should be used in place of the old <code>Template:i18n links start</code>, <code>Template:i18n entry</code>, and <code>Template:i18n links end</code> combination.</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope this does not alienate or inconvenience international users; these changes were made primarily to facilitate wiki maintenance and administration and to simplify inter-language linking. Thanks for all your translations and other contributions thus far, and please continue making ArchWiki the envy of distributions world-wide!

<p>A wiki is a collection of knowledge, most of which ends up being how-tos, which is to be expected. Let us always remember to add the 'why' to our how-tos. Explanatory information always goes further toward imparting knowledge than does instruction alone. Adding explanatory wiki articles is also welcome. Why not add one if you are qualified? 
</p>
<p>Thanks for the recent increase in contribution to the wiki! Please keep the knowledge coming.
